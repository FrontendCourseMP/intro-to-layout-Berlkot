                    We had the same problem as you. After countless all-nighters and a lot of lost nerves, we were
                    finally
                    able to recover our wallets. Since then, we can offer our experience, know-how and toolkit to help
                    you
                    recover your wallets.

                    About us:
                    Our Story and Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies, including using Bitcoin for payments, mining, and
                    trading with different strategies. We also considered starting a company and extensively researched
                    Ethereum and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a viable business model. Concerns about
                    government intervention and the potential ban of Bitcoin always lingered. As a result, we pursued
                    other entrepreneurial ventures and found some validation when the ICO wave ended with a crash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise. The influx of capital from established
                    institutions, including the financial industry, made it increasingly challenging for the government
                    to ban Bitcoin. However, we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so. Recently, when we
                    attempted to transfer our old, now more valuable Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered
                    that we had lost access to them completely. We were unable to locate our wallets in the first place.

                            By a stupid mistake, I wrote down only 11 of 12 words of my seed phrase. Desperately I tried
                            it
                            myself
                            but gave up after a short time. By chance, I came across ReWallet and asked if it would be

                            to
                            restore access to my wallet. Shorthand later we arranged a meeting in Berlin for the

                            the

                            I had pretty much written off my lost wallet until I came across ReWallet in forums. The
                            good
                            reviews
                            prompted me to make an inquiry on the ReWallet site. At first, I was skeptical. But that was
                            quickly
                            dispelled. Promptly came a response, and it was probed whether a recovery of my wallet
                            possible.
                            After
                            about 1 week came the positive news. Then everything went quickly and I was back in
                            possession
                            of my
                            Wallet.
