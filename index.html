                We had the same problem as you. After countless all-nighters and a lot of lost nerves, we were finally
                able to recover our wallets. Since then, we can offer our experience, know-how and toolkit to help you
                recover your wallets.

                About us:
                Our Story and Mission
            </h2>
            <p>
                We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies, including using Bitcoin for payments, mining, and
                trading with different strategies. We also considered starting a company and extensively researched
                Ethereum and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a viable business model. Concerns about
                government intervention and the potential ban of Bitcoin always lingered. As a result, we pursued
                other entrepreneurial ventures and found some validation when the ICO wave ended with a crash.

            </p>
            <p>
                The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise. The influx of capital from established
                institutions, including the financial industry, made it increasingly challenging for the government
                to ban Bitcoin. However, we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so. Recently, when we
                attempted to transfer our old, now more valuable Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered
                that we had lost access to them completely. We were unable to locate our wallets in the first place.
